# Save Selection as Prompt Feature

## Overview

This new feature allows users to quickly save highlighted text from any webpage as a prompt in their RCP (Right Click Prompt) extension. Users can access this functionality through two methods:

1. **Right-click context menu** - When text is highlighted on any webpage
2. **Extension popup button** - "ðŸ’¾ Save Selection" button in the extension popup

## How It Works

### Method 1: Right-Click Context Menu

1. **Highlight text** on any webpage
2. **Right-click** on the selected text
3. **Select** "Right Click Prompt â†’ ðŸ’¾ Save Selection as Prompt" from the context menu
4. **Category selection modal** will appear with:
   - Preview of the selected text
   - Optional title input (auto-generated from first few words)
   - List of existing categories with prompt counts
   - Option to create a new category
5. **Select or create a category** and click "Save Prompt"

### Method 2: Extension Popup Button

1. **Highlight text** on any webpage
2. **Click the RCP extension icon** to open the popup
3. **Click the "ðŸ’¾ Save Selection" button**
4. **Category selection modal** will appear (same as above)
5. **Select or create a category** and click "Save Prompt"

## User Experience

### Visual Design

5. **Automatic integration** with existing prompt library

### Error Handling
- **Graceful handling** of missing text selection
- **Clear error messages** for failed operations
- **Fallback mechanisms** for different browser states

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Management
- **Temporary storage** of selected text using `browser.storage.local`
- **Automatic cleanup** of temporary data after successful save
- **Integration** with existing folder/prompt storage system

### Security & Permissions
- **Uses existing permissions** (contextMenus, scripting, activeTab, storage)
- **Safe text handling** with proper HTML escaping
- **Content script injection** only when explicitly requested by user

### Browser Compatibility
- **Firefox optimized** using `browser.*` APIs
- **Graceful degradation** for different browser states
- **Cross-origin compatibility** for different webpage types

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Basic functionality** - Highlight text and save via context menu
2. **Popup functionality** - Highlight text and save via extension popup
3. **Category management** - Select existing category and create new one
4. **Title editing** - Modify auto-generated title
5. **Error handling** - Try to save without text selection
6. **Edge cases** - Very long text, special characters, empty categories
7. **Dark mode** - Test interface in dark mode environments

# üöÄ FRESH SESSION START - READ THIS FIRST

## üî¥ CRITICAL: USE THE DOCUMENTATION!
The `/Docs` folder has 16+ guides with EVERY answer you need. Check docs for EVERYTHING - even if you think you know. The docs have solutions to problems you haven't hit yet. READ THEM CONSTANTLY.

## Your Mission:
You're continuing the SD-DarkMaster-Pro project at 95% completion. Follow the 8-step startup flow EXACTLY.

## Step 1: Read These Files IN ORDER (10 minutes):
```bash
# 1. The startup flow (CRITICAL - follow exactly)
cat /workspace/SD-DarkMaster-Pro-SUPER-DUPER-FINAL-LAST-EDITION/README.md | head -100

# 2. Current state (know where we are)
cat /workspace/SD-DarkMaster-Pro-SUPER-DUPER-FINAL-LAST-EDITION/DYNAMIC_STATE_PROMPT.md

# 3. The rules (what you must follow)
cat /workspace/Docs/TRIMMED_Phase_2_PROMPT.md
```

## Step 2: Follow the 8-Step Flow:
The README has an "AI AGENT STARTUP FLOW" section. Follow it EXACTLY:
1. Install tools
2. Learn tools  
3. Read status
4. Analyze original
5. Review progress
6. Study UI
7. Test notebook
8. Report results

## Critical Rules:
- **ALWAYS use timeout:** `timeout 10 command`
- **DON'T modify Cells 1-3** (they're complete)
- **DO review Cells 4-5** (that's your task)
- **Test with papermill FIRST:** (automated testing)
- **JupyterLab is FALLBACK ONLY:** (if papermill fails)

## Your Current Task:
```
‚úÖ Cells 1-3: Complete and tested
‚è≥ Cell 4: Needs review (scripts/launch.py)
‚è≥ Cell 5: Needs review (scripts/auto-cleaner.py)
```

## First Command to Run:
```bash
timeout 10 ls -la /workspace/SD-DarkMaster-Pro-SUPER-DUPER-FINAL-LAST-EDITION/ | head -20
```

## Expected First Response Format:
```
Starting SD-DarkMaster-Pro continuation...
‚úÖ Project found at correct location
‚úÖ Reading startup flow from README
[Continue with 8-step process...]
```

**START NOW - The README has everything you need!**
